# 2048 Game in Python

![2048 Game](game_screenshot.png)

## Introduction

This is a Python implementation of the popular puzzle game "2048." The game is played on a 4x4 grid where the player combines tiles with the same numbers to reach the elusive 2048 tile.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
- Keyboard arrow keys for tile movement.
- Score tracking.
- Game over detection.
- Easy-to-understand code structure, making it a great learning resource for data structures and Python programming.

## Getting Started

To run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2048-game-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd 2048-game-python
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Use the arrow keys to move tiles and try to reach the 2048 tile.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move tiles on the grid.
- Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide.
- The game ends when there are no more valid moves to make or when you reach the 2048 tile.
